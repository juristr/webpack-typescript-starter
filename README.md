Webpack 2 + TypeScript starter
---

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/juristr/webpack-typescript-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/juristr/webpack-typescript-starter)

This is by far no sophisticated starter or whatever. The goal is to get the simplest possible setup to get you started with Webpack 2 and TypeScript. You can then start from here and add further stuff you need, such as SASS compilation, add framework specific stuff etc.

Also check out the official Webpack 2 docs for a proper TypeScript setup: https://webpack.js.org/guides/webpack-and-typescript/

_Note, this is still a WIP. Contributions/suggestions are welcome :smiley:_
